Here some soldering tips before starting building the variometer.

First **always check the component's placement after soldering the first pin**. Once two pins of the component are soldered is become very difficult to move or desolder it. So always solder in three steps :

1. Solder just **one** pin

{% include tutoimg.md name="stip2.JPG" %}

2. Check the component's placement. If it's not good, heat the solder again while replacing it.

3. When the placement seems perfect you can solder the other pins.

Next **don't hesitate to heat the solder sufficiently**. The components used in this tutorial are not very temperature sensitive and making good quality soldering is determinant. I advise soldering each pin in two steps :

1. Apply just a little amount of solder two make contact between the two parts
2. Heat the solder again **at least 2 seconds** before applying the right amount of solder

Pay particular attention to ground plane connections. Like this :

They are very difficult to heat due to the hight temperature dicipation. Don't hesitate to let the soldering iron until 10 seconds.

Finally pay attention that **all the soldering in the center of the board need to be as flat as possible** to avoid damaging the LiPo battery placed just under the PCB :
