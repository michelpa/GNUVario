You need now to remove all the pin headers plastic insulation. **Keep calm and patient during this steps** ! It's very easy to bend to pins during this operation and this will will make the next step more complicated. **Don't apply too much strength on the pins** and try to remove the insulation vertically.

There is many possible techniques. You can use a cutting plier :
