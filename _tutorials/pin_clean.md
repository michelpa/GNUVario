You need now to remove all the pin headers plastic insulation. **Keep calm and patient during this step !** It's very easy to bend the pins during this operation and this will make the next step a lot more complicated. **Don't apply too much strength on the pins** and try to remove the insulation vertically. If you find too difficult to remove them, try to warm the PCB with a hair dryer.

Many techniques can be used. You can use a cutting pliers :

Or a screw driver. But **be careful to not damage the PCB** :

The can also try to remove the insulation from the top. This is the safest technique but it's not easy to grab the plastic. If you find a better technique say it to me !

**Be very very careful with the screen connector !** It is not easy to access and the pin absolutely need to stay straight.
