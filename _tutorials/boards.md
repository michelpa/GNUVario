Take now the Arduino, the SD cards reader and the charging board :
{% include tutoimg.md name="IMG_6387.JPG" %}

Place the Arduino board like this. ** Don't apply too much strength ! ** If you can't insert the board check if there is some bended pins.
{% include tutoimg.md name="IMG_6388.JPG" %}

Next place the SD card reader and the charging board like this :
{% include tutoimg.md name="IMG_6389.JPG" %}

Make sure all the boards are flat on the PCB.
{% include tutoimg.md name="IMG_6390.JPG" %}

Solder just **one** pin of the Arduino board, check the placement and solder the opposite pin.
{% include tutoimg.md name="IMG_6391.JPG" %}
{% include tutoimg.md name="IMG_6392.JPG" %}

Solder the other pins. **Be very carefull to now forget some of them**.
{% include tutoimg.md name="forget.JPG" %}

Same thing on the SD card reader and the charging board. Solder one pin, check placement, solder the other pins.
